# Gmail Email Setup Instructions

Your email subscription form is working! Here's what I need to enable real email sending to raneaniket23@gmail.com:

## Requirements for Gmail Integration

### 1. Gmail App Password (Required)
You need to create an App Password for your Gmail account:

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Google Account
2. Go to **Google Account Settings** → **Security**
3. Under "2-Step Verification", find **App passwords**
4. Generate a new App Password for "Mail"
5. **Save this 16-character password** - you'll need it

### 2. Provide These Credentials
Once you have the App Password, provide me with:
- **Your Gmail address**: raneaniket23@gmail.com (already configured)
- **Your App Password**: The 16-character password from step 1

## Current Status

✅ **Email form is working** - users can enter emails and submit
✅ **API endpoint functional** - receiving and validating emails
✅ **Recipient set to raneaniket23@gmail.com**
✅ **Logging all subscriptions** to console
⚠️ **Ready for Gmail credentials** - just need your App Password

## What Happens Next

Once you provide the App Password, I'll:
1. Configure the secure email transporter
2. Enable real Gmail sending
3. Test the email functionality
4. Confirm emails are reaching raneaniket23@gmail.com

**Note**: The form currently shows success messages and logs everything - it just needs your Gmail App Password to send actual emails.
